# AstroPH_RAG
This repository is a practical implementation of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) designed to quickly retrieve information from the daily published papers on the arXiv website.

---

## Features
- **Automated Retrieval:** Quickly fetch and process daily published papers on arXiv.
- **Question-Answering:** Use Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to answer user-specific queries based on the context of scientific articles.
- **LLaMA 3 Integration:** Employs the **LLaMA 3 8B model** for enhanced language understanding and generation.
- **Customizable Inputs:** Flexible prompts and configurations for tailored responses.
- **Scalable Design:** Built to effectively handle the growing volume of arXiv papers.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language for implementation.
- **Hugging Face Transformers**: For LLM-based text generation and RAG integration.
- **LLaMA 3 8B Model**: A cutting-edge language model for advanced text generation and retrieval tasks.
- **PyTorch**: For managing LLM frameworks and computations.
- **LangChain**: To simplify the retrieval-augmented generation process.
- **ChromaDB** - Vector database for storing and retrieving embeddings
- **Docker** *(Optional)*: For containerizing the application and ensuring consistent environments.
