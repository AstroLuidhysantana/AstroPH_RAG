Moreover, prior work has shown that these galaxies do not exhibit X-ray or optical AGN signatures. Therefore, we recommend caution when using mid-IR color-color diagnostics for AGN selection in dwarf galaxies, since, as directly exemplified in this sample, they can be contaminated by massive star clusters with ongoing star formation.'),\n",

To investigate theories of spheroidal galaxy formation, the objective of this work is to analyse the star formation histories (SFHs) of a sample of three isolated elliptical galaxies in the local Universe observed with MUSE at $z<0.06$. With BUDDI, we decompose the integral field unit (IFU) datacubes into two components with Sérsic profiles, which roughly correspond to the two phases of in-situ and ex-situ star formation. To constrain the mode of growth in these galaxies, we derived the mass and light-weighted stellar ages and metallicities, and created the 2D stellar population maps of each component using pPXF.

The co-dominant outer component, however, had assembled the bulk of its stellar mass shortly after the inner component did, through accretion via dry mergers and possible gas accretion.

This unique shape is mainly caused by the movement of the galaxy within a cluster, during which the radio jets are deflected by the intra-cluster medium. A combined method, which involves a deep learning-based radio source finder along with visual inspection, has been utilized to search for BTRGs from the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty-centimeters survey images. Consequently, a catalog of 4876 BTRGs has been constructed, among which 3871 are newly discovered. Based on the classification scheme of the opening angle between the two jets of the galaxy, BTRGs are typically classified as either wide-angle-tail (WAT) sources or narrow-angle-tail (NAT) sources.

The multiple dry merging mechanism is able to explain all the main characteristics of the observed scaling relations of galaxies, such as slopes, scatters, curvatures and zones of exclusion. The distribution of galaxies in these planes is continuously changing across time because of the merging activity and other physical processes, such as star formation, quenching, energy feedback, and so forth. The simple merger theory presented here yields the correct distribution of galaxies in the main scaling relations at all cosmic epochs. The precision is comparable with that obtained by the modern cosmo-hydro-dynamical simulations, with the advantage of providing a rapid exploratory response on the consequences engendered by different physical effects.'),\n",

We argue that this indicates a direct view of the wind launching region and, together with an absence of polar elongation, this implies that any wind would be launched in a preferentially equatorial direction or blown out by strong radiation pressure. The size-wavelength relation for both objects shows a preferentially disky equatorial dust distribution.

We compare our size measurements with the predictions from two variants of a state-of-the-art semi-analytic model (SAM), one which includes starvation and the other incorporating both starvation and ram-pressure stripping (RPS). Our data appear to disfavor the SAM, which includes RPS for the rich group, filament, and cluster samples, which contributes to improved constraints for general models of galaxy quenching.'),\n",

This phenomenon has been dubbed as \\\\say{anisotropic quenching}, \\\\say{angular conformity} or \\\\say{angular segregation}, and it describes how satellite galaxies along the major axis of the BCG are more likely to be quenched than those along the minor axis. A highly significant anisotropic quenching signal is found for satellites, with a peak in $(B-R)$ and $f_{\\\\text{pass.}}$ along the major axis. We are the first to measure anisotropic quenching out to cluster-centric radii of $3R_{200}$ ($R_{200\\\\text{, med.}} \\\\approx 933$ \\\\si{\\\\kilo\\\\parsec}).

This is the first time a radial peak of the anisotropic quenching signal has been measured directly. We suggest that this peak could be caused by a build-up of backsplash galaxies at this radius. Finally, we find that $f_{\\\\text{pass.}}$ is significantly higher along the major axis for fixed values of local surface density. The density drops less rapidly along the major axis and so satellites spend more time being pre-processed here compared to the minor axis. We therefore conclude that pre-processing in large-scale structure, and not active galactic nuclei outflows (AGN), is the cause of the anisotropic quenching signal in massive galaxy clusters, however this may not be the cause in lower mass halos.'),\n",

However, detecting them in astronomical images is difficult due to the prevalence of non-lensing objects. To address this challenge, we developed a generative deep learning model called VariLens, built upon a physics-informed variational autoencoder. This model seamlessly integrates three essential modules: image reconstruction, object classification, and lens modeling, offering a fast and comprehensive approach to strong lens analysis. VariLens is capable of rapidly determining both (1) the probability that an object is a lens system and (2) key parameters of a singular isothermal ellipsoid (SIE) mass model -- including the Einstein radius ($\\\\theta_\\\\mathrm{E}$), lens center, and ellipticity -- in just milliseconds using a single CPU.

To identify new lensed quasar candidates, we begin with an initial sample of approximately 80 million sources, combining HSC data with multiwavelength information from various surveys. After applying a photometric preselection aimed at locating $z>1.5$ sources, the number of candidates is reduced to 710,966. Subsequently, VariLens highlights 13,831 sources, each showing a high likelihood of being a lens.
